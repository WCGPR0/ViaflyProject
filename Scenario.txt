On the way home, Carol sees a clothing store and realizes she needs new

clothes for the coming Fall. She walks in, but isn’t sure if the store has what she

is looking for. In fact, she doesn’t even know what the store even carries!

Viafly to the rescue! We asked the store owner for their inventory, and now we

have a list of items in a CSV file attached here:

Ideally, Carol wants to do the following with the App:

1. Find the list of items that are in-stock

2. Search by the items name

3. Filter items based on categories

4. Sort the items by price
